# PreferentialStyles
_Custom styles for an ugly web_

The scope of this repository is minimal. It exists only as a central location for such visual and UI changes as seem useful to me, and which I want to be able to access from any location.

Given that these changes should be able to be applied universally, only custom user stylesheets are include (i.e. no actual code changes). In addition, the number of changes being made generally remain few, the goal being to (in most cases) respect the conceptual styling of the host while making adjustments to suite personal preference and browsing habits.

All adjustments are catered to my own whim and YMMV significantly. That being said, the _goal_ is generally to follow mostly "standard" practices where this does not directly interfere with personal preference.
